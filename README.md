# PumpNow.fun - Bump-Bot for Pump.fun and Raydium

This web based bump bot will keep you on the front page of Pump.fun or keep your volume up on Raydium

Access the bot at [PumpNow.fun](https://pumpnow.fun)

At this point in time, it is not necessary to connect a wallet with wallet connect (Solflare, Phanton, etc). 
We will be implementing fee tiers which will utilize connected wallets. 
# PLEASE DO NOT PROVIDE A PRIVATE KEY FOR A WALLET YOU DO NOT WISH TO TRADE FROM!!!

1. Interval: Delay between each transaction in seconds
2. Sol per Buy: Amount of SOL to spend on each buy
3. Duration: How long the bot will run for in minutes
4. Slippage %: Slippage tolerance


# Private Key

Sadly due to the way wallets work a private key is required to make transactions. We do not store any private keys. We recommend creating a new wallet for this purpose.

SolFlare and Phantom are both creating "burner wallets" that we will use once made public.


# Running the Bump Bot

Once you have set up your settings and added your private key, you can run the bot by clicking the "Start" button.
The bot will start trading after the initial Interval. The bot will place as many as 3 consecutive buys before selling. 
Clicking Stop will stop the bot from trading and should sell remaining tokens (some errors due to laggy network may occur)

# Fee to use

To keep our services up and running we do charge 0.5% of the SOL value of the trade.
